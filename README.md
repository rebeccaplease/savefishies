Save the fishes!

Game made using Processing.  You play as an octopus who want to save its fish friends from being caught by the fishermen.  Move around with the arrow keys to grab the hooks before they get the fish! Lose three fish and it's game over.

There's a surprise challenge at the end of the level.

To run: open the file in Processing and run
